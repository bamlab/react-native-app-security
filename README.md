# Installation and setup

This package is designed for use in expo apps with [development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

```sh
yarn add @bam.tech/react-native-app-security
```

Add the config plugin to `app.config.ts` / `app.config.js` / `app.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@bam.tech/react-native-app-security",
      {
        "sslPinning": {
          "yahoo.com": [
            "TQEtdMbmwFgYUifM4LDF+xgEtd0z69mPGmkp014d6ZY=",
            "rFjc3wG7lTZe43zeYTvPq8k4xdDEutCmIhI5dn4oCeE="
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Anytime you change the config, don't forget to run:

```sh
yarn expo prebuild
```

# Features

## SSL Pinning

> **ü•∑ What's the threat?** Attackers intercepting your app's network requests and accessing private data or sending malicious responses. [More details](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/General/0x04f-Testing-Network-Communication/#restricting-trust-identity-pinning)

This package implements [public key pinning](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Pinning_Cheat_Sheet.html#public-key) using [TrustKit](https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit) on iOS and the certificate pinner included in OkHttp on Android.

### Configuration

```jsonc
[
  "@bam.tech/react-native-app-security",
  {
    "sslPinning": {
      // The hostname you want to pin, without `https://`
      "yahoo.com": [
        // The public key hashes for the pinned certificates, without a `sha256/` prefix
        "TQEtdMbmwFgYUifM4LDF+xgEtd0z69mPGmkp014d6ZY=",
        "rFjc3wG7lTZe43zeYTvPq8k4xdDEutCmIhI5dn4oCeE="
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Generating the public key hashes

TODO

### Testing

To test that SSL pinning is working as expected, you can:

- break (change) a certificate and check that the connection fails _(don't forget to `yarn expo prebuild` then `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to rebuild the app)_
- set up a proxy (we love [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io)) and check that the connection fails
